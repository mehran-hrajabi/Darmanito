# Darmanito
Darmanito is my first internship test project and is intended to build responsive web pages.
In the 1st phase, home page is implemented in pure HTML/CSS/JS.
2nd phase adds three additional pages to the project. New components are implemented with Bootstrap 4 and all styles are handled by SASS.
